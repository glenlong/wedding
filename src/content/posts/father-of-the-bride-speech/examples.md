Looking for speech examples? Don't worry, I've got you covered!

Reviewing a few concrete examples to see what other people have done is a great way to get a few ideas for your own speech.

However, try to avoid the temptation to borrow ideas wholesale because you never know how many other people will have done exactly the same thing.

Wedding guests look forward to the speeches and nothing disappoint them more than feeling your speech is just a collection of familiar lines borrowed from other speeches.

But with that warning in place, let's jump in.

## Icebreaker Examples

It's important to have a strong opening to your Father of the Bride speech since it gets people's attention and sets the right tone for an enjoyable speech.

You don't have to lead with humour, although that is usually very effective, but try to avoid well-worn jokes that some people may have heard before.

The best icebreaker will be specific to the occasion and a gently humorous opener that's personal to you will almost always be better than a stock line taken from a list of wedding speech jokes you found online.

That said, here are some quick examples to get your creative juices flowing:

> "I'm David, Melanie's proud dad and Simon's brand new father-in-law. And if none of those names are familiar to you, there's a good chance you're at the wrong wedding."

> "The last time I stood up in front of a crowd with a microphone in my hand I was belting out a drunken version of 'I Will Survive'. But the less said about my Groom speech the better."

> "I struggled a bit with writing my speech because my daughter and my wife gave me completely opposite advice. Beccy said I shouldn't say anything stupid, smutty or embarrassing. While Carole said I should just be myself!"

After the icebreaker it's time to start your speech proper. On the big day make sure you pause for any laughter and start with confidence and poise.

## Examples of Bride and Groom Toasts

When it comes to raising a toast to the Bride and Groom, you don't need to be particularly creative with your choice of words. Your aim is simply to clearly signpost the end of your speech and prompt the guests to raise their glasses.

Here are some simple ways to raise a toast:

> "Finally, it's my great pleasure to invite you all to stand and raise your glasses in a toast to our wonderful Bride and Groom!"

> "Ladies and gentlemen, will you please be upstanding and join me in a toast to the happy couple, Beccy and Simon, the Bride and Groom."

> "Right, it's time for me to stop talking and you lot to start drinking. So please raise your glasses and let's toast Mrs and Mr Simpson, the Bride and Groom!"

> "Before I hand over to my brand new son-in-law Simon, aka the Groom, please grab your glasses, get on your feet and let's toast the happy couple."

Once you've made your toast, it's time to sit, turn your attention to the Groom and let him take over the reins with his own speech.
