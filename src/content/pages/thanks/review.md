### Here's what happens next...

As soon as you're ready, send an email to info@weddingspeechcoach.com and either paste your speech into the body of the email, or attach it as a rich text or Word file.

**Please also include the following information about the event itself:**

- The date of the wedding
- The type of speech you're due to deliver (e.g., father of the bride)
- The overall tone of the wedding (e.g., large vs intimate, formal vs casual)
- Another other information you think is relevant

I'll confirm receipt of your speech by email (usually within 24 hours) and will aim to get you my feedback within 72 hours of receiving your speech.

**I'm looking forward to working with you!**

Glen
