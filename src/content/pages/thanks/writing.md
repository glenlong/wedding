### Here's what happens next...

When you're ready, please email info@weddingspeechcoach.com with the following information:

- The date of the wedding
- The type of speech you're due to deliver (e.g., father of the bride)
- The overall tone of the wedding (e.g., large vs intimate, formal vs casual)
- Another other information you think is relevant

**I'll confirm receipt of your speech by email (usually within 24 hours) and send you some prompt questions to help me gather the material I'll need to write the first draft.**

*Note: I'll aim to send you an edited version of your speech within 72 hours of receiving your answers.*

**I'm looking forward to working with you!**
