### Here's what happens next...

As soon as you're ready, send an email to info@weddingspeechcoach.com and either paste your speech into the body of the email, or attach it as a rich text or Word file.

**Please also include the following information about the event itself:**

- The date of the wedding
- The type of speech you're due to deliver (e.g., father of the bride)
- The overall tone of the wedding (e.g., large vs intimate, formal vs casual)
- Another other information you think is relevant

I'll confirm receipt of your speech by email (usually within 24 hours) and ask any additional questions I need before getting started.

My aim is to send you an edited version of your speech within 72 hours of receiving your email.

**I'm looking forward to working with you!**

Glen
