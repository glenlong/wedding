## The Essentials

We'll start by covering a few of the essentials before going into more details on important topics.

### 🏹 Main Purpose of the Speech

The main purpose of the Father of the Bride Speech is to welcome the guests to the wedding and give an insight into the Bride’s personality and her formative years.

The speech is also a fond tribute to the Bride and a celebration of a new chapter in her life.

### 🕐 Timing of the Speech

The Father of the Bride usually speaks first, before the Groom and the Best Man.

### 📋 Duties to be Covered

In his speech, the Father of the Bride will traditionally:
- officially welcome guests to the wedding
- raise a toast to the Bride and Groom (at end)

He will usually also:
- mention any absent or deceased family or friends
- acknowledge his wife, on whose behalf he is also speaking

### 🏛️ Simple Speech Structure

A simple but effective speech structure is:

##### 1. Welcome the guests

Thank everyone for coming and mention any key absences

##### 2. Acknowledge the occasion

Say a few positive words about the day so far

##### 3. Share stories about the Bride

Tell 2 or 3 anecdotes from the Bride’s early life

##### 4. Compliment the Bride

Praise your daughter and say why you’re proud of her

##### 5. Raise a Toast!

Invite guests to raise their glasses and toast the bride and groom

### 🎵 Recommended Tone

The Father of the Bride Speech should be:

- generous and loving
- happy and proud

Also remember:
- sensitive issues or topics which might embarrass the Bride should be avoided
- it’s okay to be a little sentimental!

### 🎤 Tips for Delivery

When delivering your speech:
- aim to speak for no longer than 5 - 10 minutes
- keep it conversational – i.e. try to speak as you would normally speak
- take your time – pause between each of your main points
- use small cue cards to prompt you (don’t try to do it all from memory or read from a script)
- And make sure you practice before the big day!

### 🚫 Pitfalls to Avoid

The Father of the Bride should try to avoid:
- alluding to any financial support that might have been given for the wedding
- telling stories that genuinely embarrass the Bride
- neglecting to mention the mother of the bride
- relying on all-too-familiar lines and clichés
- drinking too much before the speeches!
