## The Essentials

We'll start by covering a few of the essentials before going into more details on important topics.

### 🏹 Main Purpose of the Speech

The main purpose of the Groom Speech is to thank key people and give guests an insight into the couple and their relationship.

The speech is also an opportunity for the Groom to express his love for his new Bride.

### 🕐 Timing of the Speech

The Groom usually speaks second, after the Father of the Bride but before the Best Man.

### 📋 Duties to be Covered

In his speech, the Groom will traditionally:
- thank the Father of the Bride for his speech and his toast to the Bride and Groom
- raise his own toast to the Bridesmaids

He will usually also:
- hand out any presents to the wedding party on behalf of him and his new wife
- say a few words about his Best Man

### 🏛️ Simple Speech Structure

##### 1. Acknowledge the Father of the Bride

Accept his toast and thank him for his speech

##### 2. Express your gratitude

Thank key people by name and give out any presents

##### 3. Tell the story of your relationship

Say how you met and share some important memories

##### 4. Pay tribute to the Bride

Say why you love her and share hopes for the future

##### 5. Raise a Toast!

Invite guests to raise their glasses and toast the bridesmaids.

### 🎵 Recommended Tone

The Groom Speech should be:
- warm and generous
- happy and romantic

Also remember:
- humour can be very effective – particularly if it’s self-deprecating
- sensitive topics (such as temporary break-ups or past relationships) should be avoided or handled with great delicacy

### 🎤 Tips for Delivery

When delivering your speech:
- aim to speak for no longer than 5 - 10 minutes
- keep it conversational – i.e. try to speak as you would normally speak
- take your time – pause between each of your main points
- use small cue cards to prompt you (don’t try to do it all from memory or read from a script)
- And make sure you practice before the big day!

### 🚫 Pitfalls to Avoid

The Groom should try to avoid:
- thanking too many people by name
- alluding to any family disagreements
- making ‘in’ references not everyone will get
- using all-too-familiar ‘jokes’ and clichés
- drinking too much before the speeches!
