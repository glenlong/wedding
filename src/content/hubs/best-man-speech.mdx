## The Essentials

We'll start by covering a few of the essentials before going into more details on important topics.

### 🏹 Main Purpose of the Speech

The main purpose of the Best Man Speech is to give guests an entertaining insight into the Groom’s life and character from the perspective of a close friend.

The speech is also a fond tribute to the Groom and a celebration of a new chapter in his life.

### 🕐 Timing of the Speech

The Best Man usually speaks last, after the Father of the Bride and the Groom.

### 📋 Duties to be Covered

In his speech, the Best Man will traditionally:
- accept the Groom’s toast to the Bridesmaids
- raise his own toast to the Bride and Groom

He will usually also:
- thank the Groom for choosing him as Best Man
- thank the Bride and Groom for their presents to the wedding party
- read out messages from absent friends & family

### 🏛️ Simple Speech Structure

A simple but effective speech structure is:

##### 1. Take over from the Groom
Accept his toast and thank him for his speech

##### 2. Introduce yourself

Say who are you and how you know the Groom

##### 3. Share stories about the Groom

Tell 2 or 3 anecdotes that give us an insight into the Groom

##### 4. Pay tribute to the Bride

Compliment her and say why they make a great team

##### 5. Raise a Toast!

Invite guests to raise their glasses and toast the bride and groom.


### 🎵 Recommended Tone

The Best Man Speech should be:
- warm and humorous
- gently mocking (but not humiliating)

Also remember:
- the language should be suitable for all (i.e. no swearing)
- sensitive topics and more ‘adult’ references should be avoided altogether, or handled very carefully, e.g. with subtle euphemism

### 🎤 Tips for Delivery

When delivering your speech:
- aim to speak for no longer than 5 - 10 minutes
- keep it conversational – i.e. try to speak as you would normally speak
- take your time – pause between each of your main points
- use small cue cards to prompt you (don’t try to do it all from memory or read from a script)
- And make sure you practice before the big day!

### 🚫 Pitfalls to Avoid

The Best Man should try to avoid:
- upsetting the Bride
- offending any of the guests
- making ‘in jokes’ not everyone will understand
- relying on all-too-familiar lines and clichés
- drinking too much before the speeches!
