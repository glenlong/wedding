## How It Works

I will write a speech from scratch based on information provided by you.

This will be an original speech (up to 1,200 words) tailored specifically to your event and the key people involved.

I will use my experience to produce a well-structured speech, with a clear flow of ideas and entertaining content.

While writing the speech I will take into account:
- the size and ‘tone’ of the wedding (small, informal or large, formal)
- your level of experience/comfort in delivering a speech
- your desired tone

### Pricing

£249 (inc. VAT)

## Other Services

If you already have a draft of your speech and simply want some expert feedback, take a look at the Speech Review service.

If you have a draft but would like me to review it and rewrite it for you, see the Speech Redraft service.
