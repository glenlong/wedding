## How It Works
I will edit a draft of your speech (up to 1,200) to improve the clarity, structure and flow. I will also make up to two further revisions based on your feedback.

The redraft may include:
- improving wording to make the speech easier to deliver and understand
- improving structure to make the speech more coherent and easier to follow
- working on links between sections to improve the overall flow

Where possible I will also try to:
- highlight opportunities to add humour to the speech (if required) together with suggested lines
