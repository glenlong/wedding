## How It Works

This starts with you providing a full-length draft of your speech (maximum 1,200 words).

I will review it in detail and provide specific recommendations in the form of a report, paying particular attention to helping you improve:
- overall structure
- transitions between different ideas
- additional opportunities for humour

I will also advise on:
- appropriate tone
- originality
- any traditional duties that have been left out

## Other Services

If you would like me edit your speech directly instead of providing feedback, check out the Speech Editing Service.

If you're struggling to write a speech and would like me to write it for you, see the Speech Writing service.
