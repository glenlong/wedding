## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

**I'll write an original and engaging speech from scratch based on information provided by you.**

The speech (up to 1,200 words) tailored specifically to your event and the key people involved.

First, I will ask you some questions about the event to gather all of the information I need.

Once I have all the raw material, I will use my experience to produce a rich and personal speech, with a clear flow of ideas and engaging content.

**While writing the speech I will take into account:**
- the size and ‚Äòtone‚Äô of the wedding (small, informal or large, formal)
- your level of experience/comfort in delivering a speech
- your personality and the desired tone for your speech
