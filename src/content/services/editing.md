## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
**I will edit a draft of your speech (up to 1,200 words) to improve the clarity, structure and flow.**

(I will also make up to two further revisions based on your feedback.)

**When editing your speech I will aim to:**
- improve the wording to make the speech easier to deliver and understand
- improve the structure to make the speech more coherent and easier to follow
- improve the transitions between sections to enhance the overall flow

**If required, I will also:**
- highlight opportunities to add humour to the speech together with suggested lines

## ü™ß Alternative Options
- If you only need feedback on your speech so you can make the changes yourself, see my [Speech Review Service](/services/review/).
- If you're struggling to write a whole speech and would like me to write it for you with your guidance, see my [Speech Writing Service](/services/writing/).
