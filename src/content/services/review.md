## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

**This starts with you sending me a full-length draft of your speech (maximum 1,200 words).**

I will review it in detail and provide specific recommendations in the form of a report.

**I will pay particular attention to helping you improve:**
- the overall structure of the speech
- the transitions between different ideas
- any additional opportunities for humour

**I will also advise on:**
- appropriate tone
- originality of ideas
- traditional duties to be included

## ü™ß Alternative Options

- Instead of getting feedback, if you would like me edit and polish your speech for you, check out my [Speech Editing Service](/services/editing/).
- If you're struggling to write a whole speech and would like me to write it for you with your guidance, see my [Speech Writing Service](/services/writing/).
